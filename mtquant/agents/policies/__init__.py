"""
RL Policies and Algorithms

Contains implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms optimized for trading:
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization): Stable, sample-efficient
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic): Off-policy, good for continuous actions
- TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG): Robust continuous control

All policies are built on Stable Baselines3 framework and customized for
trading-specific requirements like position sizing and risk management.
