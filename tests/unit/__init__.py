"""
Unit Tests

Unit tests for individual components and functions.
Tests are isolated and use mocks for external dependencies.

Coverage Areas:
- Agent logic and decision making
- Risk management calculations
- Data processing and feature engineering
- Utility functions and helpers
- Model validation and serialization

All unit tests should be fast (<100ms) and deterministic.
